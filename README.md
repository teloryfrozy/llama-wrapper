# Python Wrapper For Replicate trained Llama models 
🦙 A Python module for interacting with the Meta Llama models trained via Replicate's API. 🔓

# ⚠️Disclaimer⚠️
I do not personally use this module. It is intended for skill demonstration purposes only.

This API reverse engineering project does not require any prior experience, except for understanding the basics of web development and API calls.

## 🔑 Authentication: 
As the endpoint is publicly available, there is NO NEED for an API KEY to use the model trained by Meta.

# Setup (better use a virtual environnement)
```bash
python3 -m venv py_env
source py_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Example of usage
It may be released as a python module on the official website like other similar tools.


# Improvements:
Open to pull requests for documenations, additionals features, bugs fixed
You can open issues on the official repo and I will try to solve them.
